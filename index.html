				And when I can't decide
				I let you make up my mind
				But our dictionary characters don't symbolise real life
				And although I re-embraced
				We represent the human race
				It's a different relationship girl 
				Now you're out of place
				And it hurts to let you go
				but Honey now I realised 
				It wasn't love...
			</div>
			<div class="verse" id="verse3">		
				To honour my mistake
				Or perhaps for old times sake
				I'll raise a glass, propose a toast
				And down a few in your name
				Then for one final time
				I'll say I wish that you were mine
				It wasn't love...
				It wasn't love...
				It wasn't love...
